# AutoGBT
AutoGBT stands for Automatically Optimized Gradient Boosting Trees, and is used for AutoML in a lifelong machine learning setting to classify large volume high cardinality data streams under concept-drift. AutoGBT was developed by a joint team ('autodidact.ai') from Flytxt, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi and CSIR-CEERI as a part of NIPS 2018 AutoML Challenge (The 3rd AutoML Challenge: AutoML for Lifelong Machine Learning). Our team won the first prize in the challenge. More details of the challenge is available at https://www.4paradigm.com/competition/nips2018. The work will be presented at NIPS 2018 during the Competition Track session (https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/Schedule?showEvent=10945)
